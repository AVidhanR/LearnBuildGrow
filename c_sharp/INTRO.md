#### The `C#` programming language allows you to build many types of applications, like:
- Business applications to capture, analyze, and process data.
- Dynamic web applications that can be accessed from a web browser.
- Games, both 2D and 3D.
- Financial and scientific applications.
- Cloud-based applications.
- Mobile applications.

#### Write your first line of code, in-order to print **Hello, World!**:
```cs
Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
```

#### The difference between Console.Write and Console.WriteLine:
- `Console.WriteLine()` prints a message to the output console. At the end of the line, it adds a line feed similar to pressing Enter or Return to create a new line.
- To print to the output console, but without adding a line feed at the end, you use the second technique, `Console.Write()`. So, the next call to Console.Write() prints another message to the same line.

> [!NOTE]
> `.cs` is the extension for the C# programming language.
> for example, in-order to create a `C#` file named **sampleProgram** we create like this; `sampleProgram.cs`
