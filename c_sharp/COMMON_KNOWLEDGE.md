## What is a programming language?
- Programming languages like C# let you write instructions that you want the computer to carry out.
- Each programming language has its own syntax, but after learning your first programming language and attempting to learn another one, you'll quickly realize that they all share many similar concepts.
- A programming language's job is to allow a human to express their intent in a human-readable and understandable way.
- The instructions you write in a programming language are called "source code" or just "code". Software developers write code.
At this point, a developer can update and change the code, but the computer can't understand the code. The code first must be compiled into a format that the computer can understand.

## What is compilation?
- A special program called a compiler converts your source code into a different format that the computer's central processing unit (CPU) can execute. 
- When you used the green Run button in the previous unit, the code you wrote was first compiled, then executed.

> [!NOTE]
> Why does code need to be compiled? Although most programming languages seem cryptic at first, they can be more easily understood by humans than the computer's preferred language.
> The CPU understands instructions that are expressed by turning thousands or millions of tiny switches either on or off.
> Compilers bridge these two worlds by translating your human-readable instructions into a computer-understandable set of instructions.

## What is syntax?
- The rules for writing C# code is called syntax. 
- Just like human languages have rules regarding punctuation and sentence structure, computer programming languages also have rules.
- Those rules define the keywords and operators of C# and how they are put together to form programs.
