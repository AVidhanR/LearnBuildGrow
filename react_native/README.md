## React Native

- `React Native` is a framework for building mobile applications with JavaScript and React.
- It uses the same design as React, letting you compose a rich mobile UI from declarative components.

- Explore the [React Native documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) to learn more about the framework.

- I'm currently learning React Native from [YouTube - Dave Gray](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0Zuz27SZ-6OH3xackTS2KLcnmxx5wW7c&si=8vX3B9yydPBf1ND6).
