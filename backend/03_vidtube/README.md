## Packages used

### CORS

- The Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) package is a browser-based HTTP header mechanism that **allows a server or API to indicate which origins can access and load resources**. CORS can be used for a number of purposes, including:
  - Security:
    CORS helps prevent malicious websites from accessing sensitive information on your server.
  - Resource sharing:
    CORS allows controlled access to resources on a server from a different origin, enabling web applications to make API requests to external services.
  - Relaxing browser restrictions:
    CORS can relax the guard that internet browsers typically deny access to unknown websites.
  - Exercising more control:
    CORS allows you to exercise more control over which websites should be allowed access to your server's resources
