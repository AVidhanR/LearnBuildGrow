## `Learn Build Grow`

- In this `repo` you will find various topics relate to the backend department.
- In order to experiment this `repo` make sure install the below,
  - `Postman` | `MongoDB` | `NodeJS` | `ExpressJS`
- I used the port number as 3000 and in order to check for the response and give requests to server via postman I used `127.0.0.1:3000` | `localhost:3000`
- After installing the above make sure to install the `bun` package while using `web_server` directory.
- To experiment/access the `express` directory make sure install the [express](https://expressjs.com/) package.
- I installed a logger (in `02_express` directory) for better logging of data during the requests phase on to the server. In order install the logger use the below command,

```bash
npm install winston morgan
```

- Use appropriate commands to run the above modules.
